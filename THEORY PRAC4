Algorithm:
1. Create a file “telelphone.txt”
2. Read input from the user .
3. Write the data to the file using oftsream.
4. Read the input from the file using ifstream
5. Display the contents

Theory:
A file must be opened before you can read from it or write to it. Either the ofstream or fstream object may be used
to open a file for writing and ifstream object is used to open a file for reading purpose only.
void open(const char *filename, ios::openmode mode);
Here, the first argument specifies the name and location of the file to be opened and the second argument of the
open() member function defines the mode in which the file should be opened.
When a C++ program terminates it automatically closes flushes all the streams, release all the allocated memory and
close all the opened files. But it is always a good practice that a programmer should close all the opened files before
program termination.
void close();
While doing C++ programming, you write information to a file from your program using the stream insertion
operator (<<) just as you use that operator to output information to the screen. The only difference is that you use an
ofstream or fstream object instead of the cout object.
You read information from a file into your program using the stream extraction operator (>>) just as you use that
operator to input information from the keyboard. The only difference is that you use an ifstream or fstream object
instead of the cin object
